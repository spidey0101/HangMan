# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game where players try to guess a word letter by letter before they run out of attempts.

## How to Play
1. Run the `hangman.py` file using Python.
2. Player 1 enters a word for Player 2 to guess.
3. Player 2 tries to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
4. Player 2 has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
5. Player 2 wins if they guess the word correctly within the allowed attempts.
6. Player 1 wins if Player 2 runs out of attempts without guessing the word.
