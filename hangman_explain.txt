First of all,

Welcome to the timeless Hangman game!
The objective is straightforward: determine the hidden word before time runs out.

*Flow of the Game* :-It chooses a word at random for you to guess when you first launch the game.
Each letter of the word will be represented by a string of dashes.
There's a cap on how many times you can try to guess the word correctly.

*Parts of the game* :

main(): The general flow of the game is managed by this feature.
It starts the game by choosing the secret word and putting up the first screen.
After the current game ends, it also manages the choice to play again.

play_loop()`: After a game is over, this function asks the player if they would want to continue playing.
   - {hangman()}: The actual gameplay takes place in this central portion of the game.
     The player is asked to guess a letter and is then prompted to see if it is part of the hidden word.
     - The display is updated to show the letters that were successfully predicted.
     - It counts the number of wrong guesses and updates the hangman image accordingly.

 *Participating in the Game*: - Open the `hangman.py` file to begin playing.
   - When one player comes up with a word, the other player attempts to predict it by offering potential letters.
   - One letter at a time, guess until you figure out the word or run out of chances.
